## 🧭 Overview

**Co-Spiral Framework HI×AI (CoSF)** is an open philosophical–technical framework for  
co-creating knowledge between **Human Intelligence (HI)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

Its goal is to help humans and AI **learn, reflect, and evolve together**,  
based on three progressive levels of collaboration:

| Level                     | Description                                            | Outcome                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **1. Prompt Engineering** | Crafting precise and contextual prompts                | Effective AI communication       |
| **1.5. Manual RAG**       | Merging personal context or local files without coding | Human-driven knowledge retrieval |
| **2. RAG System**         | Automated retrieval-augmented generation pipelines     | Dynamic, data-grounded AI        |
| **3. Fine-Tuning Ethos**  | Aligning AI with human values, tone, and moral intent  | Ethically co-evolving AI         |

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

1. **Share an open knowledge architecture** for human–AI co-creation.  
2. **Track versions** through GitHub tags and releases (knowledge ≈ software).  
3. **Enable accessible “Manual RAG” (Level 1.5)** for non-technical users.  
4. **Foster Telic Rung thinking** — ethical resonance and self-reflective use of AI.

## 🌱 Philosophy

> “AI is not here to replace thinking —  
> it’s here to remove friction so that human thinking can spiral further.”  
> — *CoSF Manifesto v1.1*

CoSF treats every participant as a **co-creator of meaning** —  
each contributor a *living spiral* in the human–AI continuum.
